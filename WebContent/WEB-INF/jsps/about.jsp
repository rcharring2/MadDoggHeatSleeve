      <p>I developed the idea for the Heat Sleeve as an avid
        coffee-drinker. After the repeating frustration of throwing away
        cold coffee, along with the constraints of a college budget, I
        began drawing up the idea in a journal. I first pitched it to my
        parents and sister while we were at a local coffee shop, they
        were immediately interested. Since then, they have seen every
        prototype-the good, the bad, and the ugly- and still believed in
        my idea. The idea came about after researching a technology to
        create a disposable device that works in conjunction with a
        disposable coffee cup to keep coffee at a drinkable temperature
        longer. Through discussion with those with more subject matter
        expertise and many days spent prototyping, the MadDogg Heat
        Sleeve came to life.</p>

      University in North Carolina. Ed currently serves as the Vice
      Chairman on the Elon Board of Trustees and is Chairman of their

    <p>Ed has propelled this product from concept, prototype,
      product-development, manufacturing, testing, and ultimately
      distribution. His interest and experience in restaurant and food &
      beverage has inspired success in forming a strong business. Ed
      founded Doherty Enterprises in 1985. From 1985 to 1990, Doherty
      Enterprises grew from the original 19 Roy Rogers Restaurants to 28
      Roy Rogers and 6 TJ Cinnamons, a bakery concept specializing in
      cinnamon and pecan rolls, coffee and other specialty products.</p>
    <p>Currently the company has 63 Applebeeâ€™s open in New Jersey
      and Long Island & 44 in Florida / Georgia. In 2001, Doherty
      Enterprises acquired exclusive rights to develop Panera Bread
      throughout Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island, New York.
      Subsequently, Doherty acquired the rights to Brooklyn, Queens and
      Staten Island. Currently the company operates 42 Panera Bread
      Bakery Cafes. Doherty Enterprises, Inc. currently operates 163
      restaurants, pubs and bakery cafes, with projected sales exceeding
      $526,000,000 in 2016.</p>
    <p>On December 1, 2014, the New Jersey Restaurant Association
      presented Ed Doherty with the Restaurateur of the Year award. The
      award, considered the highest distinction bestowed upon a
      restaurant owner, recognized Doherty Enterprises for its
      excellence in restaurant operations, job creation throughout the
      Garden State, ongoing community involvement and as an overall
      leader in the industry.</p>
